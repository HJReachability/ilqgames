// Core open-loop LQ game solver from Basar and Olsder, Chapter 6. All notation
// matches the text, though we shall assume that `c` (additive drift in
// dynamics) is always `0`, which holds because these dynamics are for delta x,
// delta us. Also, we have modified terms slightly to account for linear terms
// in the stage cost for control, i.e.
//       control penalty i = 0.5 \sum_j du_j^T R_ij (du_j + 2 r_ij)
//
// Solve a time-varying, finite horizon LQ game (finds open-loop Nash
// feedback strategies for both players).
//
// Assumes that dynamics are given by
//           ``` dx_{k+1} = A_k dx_k + \sum_i Bs[i]_k du[i]_k ```
//
// Returns strategies Ps, alphas. Here, all the Ps are zero (by default), and
// only the alphas are nonzero.
