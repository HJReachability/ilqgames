// Core LQ game solver from Basar and Olsder, "Preliminary Notation for
// Corollary 6.1" (pp. 279). All notation matches the text, though we
// shall assume that `c` (additive drift in dynamics) is always `0`, which
// holds because these dynamics are for delta x, delta us.
//
// Solve a time-varying, finite horizon LQ game (finds closed-loop Nash
// feedback strategies for both players).
//
// Assumes that dynamics are given by
//           ``` dx_{k+1} = A_k dx_k + \sum_i Bs[i]_k du[i]_k ```
//
// NOTE: Bs, Qs, ls, R1s, R2s are all lists of lists of matrices.
// NOTE: all indices of inner lists correspond to the "current time" k except
// for those of the Qs, which correspond to the "next time" k+1. That is,
// the kth entry of Qs[i] is the state cost corresponding to time step k+1. This
// makes sense because there is no point assigning any state cost to the
// initial state x_0.
//
// Returns strategies Ps, alphas.
